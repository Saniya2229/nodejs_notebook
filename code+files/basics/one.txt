I add this, there is no wat to remove this so you have to add into this a remove button and probly add some css for it as well as soon as i click on this button, this should remove this element ans also change my total into this so you need to subtract this anuther things is that if i go ahead and refresh this page, the card gets empty. so i want to inject API's in local storage, which we have already learned that if i add this card, there should be something inside my local storage so that IT cards cannot remains persistent and even ifi refresh, it doesn't go away
